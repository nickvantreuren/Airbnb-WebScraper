# Airbnb-WebScraper
This is the python code of a web scraper for Airbnb I used in the data gathering process of my Master thesis.

This web scraper is based on the code of Ruben Kerkhofs (https://github.com/rubenkerkhofs/Airbnb-scraping) and extended where needed. 

Also the final data set has been added. This data set has been transformed and cleaned. Also, the quantified COVID-19 state Health and Safety measurements have been added.
